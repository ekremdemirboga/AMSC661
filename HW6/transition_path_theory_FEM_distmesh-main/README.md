# transition_path_theory_FEM_distmesh
This package allows you to compute the key descriptors of transition processes between two disjont regions, A and B, of the phase space of stochastic systems evolving according to 2D SDEs. These descriptors comprise the framework of the **transition path theory** (W. E and E. Vanden-Eijnden, 2006, 2010):

--> the forward and backward committors,

--> the probability density of reactive trajectories,

--> the reactive currect,

--> the transition rate,

--> the probability that an infinitely long trajectory is reactive at a randomly chosen moment of time,

--> the probability that an infinitely long trajectory at a randomly chosen moment of time last hit A rather than B.

The committors are computed using finite element method. The finite element method rewritten on python from:

**Settings fror the overdamped Langevin dynamics**

The background on transition path theory is also found in [3]. Here we lay out the settings for the simplest case, the overdamped Langevin dynamics.

We consider the overamped Langevin dynamics 

$$dX = - \nabla V(X)dt + \sqrt{2\beta^{-1}}dW $$

in the domain with a reflecting boundary given by $$D: = \left(x : V(x) \le V_{\rm bdry}\right).$$

The invariant pdf is the Gibbs density $$\mu(x) = Z^{-1} e^{\beta V(x)},~~ Z = \int_{D} e^{-\beta V}dx.$$

The Bondary Value Problem for the committor function:
$$\nabla \cdot \left( e^{-\beta V(x)} \nabla q(x)\right) = 0, ~~ x \in D \backslash (A\cup B)$$

$$q(x) = 0,~~ x \in A$$

$$q(x) = 1, ~~ x \in B$$

**Important settings in face_TPT_driver.ipynb:**

**(The settings in other driver codes are similar)**

The Face potential has four local minima: the "eyes" are the deepest minima, and the "nose" and the "mouth" are shallower minima that can be considered as a dynamical trap.

--> xa,ya,ra,xb,yb,rb: The sets A and B are circles around the eyes centered at  (xa,ya), (xb,yb), of radii ra and rb, respectively.

--> Vbdry: The outer boundary is the level set of the potential {(x,y) : V(x,y) = Vbdry}. 

--> h0: The important parameter that determines how fine is the mesh is h0, the desired length of mesh edge.

--> generate_mesh: The boolean variable generate_mesh determines whether the mesh needs to be generated or read from the files. Set generate_mesh = True for the first run. The generated mesh will be saved to files. If you want to experiment further with the same mesh, set generate_mesh = False. Then it will be read from the files.

--> q: The variable q is the committor at the mesh points.

--> Rcurrent: The variable Rcurrent is Npts-by-2 array with components of the reactive current at the mesh points. The reactive current is given by:
$$ J_R = Z^{-1}\beta^{-1}e^{-\beta V(x)}\nabla q(x).$$

--> Rrate: The variable Rrate is the transition rate given by:
$$\nu_{AB} = Z^{-1}\beta^{-1}\int_{D\backslash(A\cup B)} \|\nabla q\|^2e^{-\beta V} dx.$$
